qm
==

This is an R package that will enable the use of the
[QMachine](https://www.qmachine.org) web service for distributing computations.

Obviously, this project is still very incomplete, and it will probably be a
little while before it becomes available on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org).
In the meantime, you can install the package and try it out by using the
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```r
devtools::install('qmachine/qm-r')
```
